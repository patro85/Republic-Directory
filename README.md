Take home code challenge.

## Assignment
Thanks for being willing to do our coding assignment! Here are the instructions:

### Setup:
For this assignment, create a fresh iOS project in Xcode. If you would like to, you are welcome to use 3rd-party libraries.

### Assignment:
- Create an iOS app that retrieves a list of individuals from a REST web service call and add these individuals to a local datastore within the app. The URL of the web service is: https://edge.ldscdn.org/mobile/interview/v2/directory
- Display the individual profile image in the table view (image URL is provided in the web service data)
- Create a profile detail view that you can get to by tapping on an individual in the list

### Expectation:
Be creative in your solution. We want to know what frameworks and libraries you used, and why. Don’t worry about over complicating your solution, keep it simple. We’ve tried to be intentionally vague on HOW to solve it, because we want to leave that part up to you. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to Hal or Jessica. If you get stuck or need more direction, that’s okay, just let us know and we’ll try to help. Once you feel like its complete and you’re ready for us to review it, push your changes up to a git repository (preferably on GitHub.com) and send us a link.

Thanks again, we’re excited to see what you can do!
